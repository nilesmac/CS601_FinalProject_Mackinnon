# Niles' About Me Website


This is a simple HTML website where I entail my journey on becoming a software engineer and GPU builder.


## Description


This website demonstrates the use of HTML for creating a static webpage. It includes basic elements such as headers, paragraphs, lists, and images.


## Features
- **Change Image On-Click**: Click on images at top of pages in order to change them.
- **Flex-Box Adjusting**: The gallery will adjust to screen size and try to fit as many images in a row that will be allowed. At full screen, you will see five cats. But, as you shrink it, it will change to four in a row, three, and so on.
- **Gallery**: Image gallery page where you can click on an image in order to see the source.
- **Change Text On-Click**: On the Interviews page, if you click on the text below the email image, you can change it to a different text box.
- **Capitalize Titles**: On the top of each page, if you click on the title, it will capitalize each word in the sentence.
